I said it should be nice  # loop register
Oh yeah that should work unless something comes up if it’s nice
    Nice # go to register 1
    That's up to you  # read user input
    Oh yeah that should work if it's not "exit"  # if user didn’t type exit...
        Yeah if you saw it not long ago then they should have it  # print what they typed.
    Oh yeah that should work if it's "exit"  # if they DID type exit (ensorlang doesn’t have an “else” statement)
        Rip
    Oh not nice
